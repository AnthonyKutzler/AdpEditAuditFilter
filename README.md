# AdpEditAuditFilter

Took a unorganized report from ADP, iterated through each line to output: 
Total clock punches, number of manager edited punches, and percentage of edits per location code. Also displays total edit percentage below each location set.
Used to limit clock discrepencies through pushing for less edits.
